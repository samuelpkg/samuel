# Samuel

Rails for AI coding assistants. A small Go CLI that ships a framework, a plugin loader, and an opinionated methodology — everything tool-specific lives in plugins.

## What it is

- **Agent-agnostic with a Claude carve-out.** `AGENTS.md` is the canonical project context. `.cursor/rules/`, `.codex/*`, and future tool-specific surfaces are produced by translator plugins — the framework knows about none of them. The lone exception is the AGENTS.md → CLAUDE.md mirror, which ships in core because Claude Code is the only major coding assistant that doesn't read AGENTS.md natively.
- **Plugin-driven.** Three tiers: **skill** (text + scripts), **WASM** (sandboxed via wazero), **OCI** (containers for heavy tools). Plugins are intended to be signed by Sigstore keyless OIDC. **v2.0 caveat:** the default verifier is a policy-only stub — `identity_patterns` and `allow_unsigned_for` are enforced, but no Sigstore math runs. `samuel doctor` prints a one-line advisory until v2.1 wires the sigstore-go backend.
- **Methodology built in.** The 4D loop (Deconstruct / Diagnose / Develop / Deliver) with Ralph-Wiggum-style iteration cap as the default. Methodology plugins add hooks; the framework runs the loop.
- **TOON-encoded runtime.** State files (`.samuel/run/*.toon`) are token-efficient for LLM context. Markdown stays for prose-heavy logs.
- **CLI-mutation pattern.** The agent never edits state directly — it runs `samuel run done <id>` or `samuel run skip <id>`. The CLI owns the schema; the agent owns the decisions.

## Install

**Homebrew (macOS/Linux):**

```bash
brew update
brew install ar4mirez/tap/samuel
```

**curl install script:**

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samuelpkg/samuel/main/install.sh | sh
```

**go install:**

```bash
go install github.com/samuelpkg/samuel/cmd/samuel@latest
```

Verify:

```bash
samuel version
samuel doctor
```

> Every release artifact is signed by Sigstore keyless OIDC. See the cosign verification snippet in any release's notes.

## 60-second tour

```bash
samuel init my-project
cd my-project

# AGENTS.md is your canonical context. CLAUDE.md was mirrored
# automatically by the built-in Claude translator — see `samuel sync`
# for how to keep it fresh after you edit AGENTS.md. .samuel/.gitignore
# was also written so the transient state stays out of git.

# Browse the registry and add a plugin:
samuel search go
samuel install go-guide

# Start the autonomous loop (dry-run first to see the prompt that
# would be sent, then drop --dry-run when you're ready):
samuel run init --prd .samuel/tasks/0001-prd-feature.md
samuel run start --dry-run --iterations 1 --yes
```

The autonomous loop is iteration-capped (Ralph Wiggum methodology) and emits hooks at every boundary. Plugins attach to the hooks; the framework drives the loop.

A ready-to-run example project lives at [`examples/tetris/`](examples/tetris/) with a complete manual-test recipe in its README.

## For v1 users

v2 is a clean break. The binary name is the same; installing v2 overwrites v1. The v1 source lives at the [`v1-final`](https://github.com/samuelpkg/samuel/tree/v1-final) tag.

If you used `CLAUDE.md` directly, you'll get `AGENTS.md → CLAUDE.md` mirroring out of the box — the built-in Claude translator handles it on every `samuel init` and `samuel sync`. (Pre-rc.4 this was a separate plugin; carve-out shipped in v2.0.0-rc.4 because Claude Code is the only major coding assistant that doesn't read AGENTS.md natively. See [AGENTS.md docs](https://samuelpkg.github.io/samuel/core/agents-md/#claude-translator) for the opt-out.) If you used `gstack` or `gbrain`, see [RFD 0008](https://samuelpkg.github.io/samuel/rfd/0008/) for the rationale and migration path.
