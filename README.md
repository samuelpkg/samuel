# Samuel

Rails for AI coding assistants. A small Go CLI that ships a framework, a plugin loader, and an opinionated methodology — everything tool-specific lives in plugins.

## What it is

- **Agent-agnostic.** `AGENTS.md` is the canonical project context. `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/rules/`, `.codex/*` are produced by translator plugins — the framework knows about none of them.
- **Plugin-driven.** Three tiers: **skill** (text + scripts), **WASM** (sandboxed via wazero), **OCI** (containers for heavy tools). Every plugin signed by Sigstore keyless OIDC.
- **Methodology built in.** The 4D loop (Deconstruct / Diagnose / Develop / Deliver) with Ralph-Wiggum-style iteration cap as the default. Methodology plugins add hooks; the framework runs the loop.
- **TOON-encoded runtime.** State files (`.samuel/run/*.toon`) are token-efficient for LLM context. Markdown stays for prose-heavy logs.
- **CLI-mutation pattern.** The agent never edits state directly — it runs `samuel run done <id>` or `samuel run skip <id>`. The CLI owns the schema; the agent owns the decisions.

Full design rationale: read [RFDs 0001–0008](https://samuelpkg.github.io/samuel/rfd/).

## Install

**Homebrew (macOS/Linux):**

```bash
brew update
brew install ar4mirez/tap/samuel
```

**curl install script:**

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samuelpkg/samuel/main/install.sh | sh
```

**go install:**

```bash
go install github.com/samuelpkg/samuel/cmd/samuel@latest
```

Verify:

```bash
samuel version
samuel doctor
```

> Every release artifact is signed by Sigstore keyless OIDC. See the cosign verification snippet in any release's notes.

## 60-second tour

```bash
samuel init my-project
cd my-project

# AGENTS.md is now in the working tree — that's your canonical context.
# Add a plugin:
samuel install go-guide

# (Optional) keep CLAUDE.md generated for tools that read it:
samuel install samuel-claude-translator

# Start the autonomous loop:
samuel run start
```

The autonomous loop is iteration-capped (Ralph Wiggum methodology) and emits hooks at every boundary. Plugins attach to the hooks; the framework drives the loop. Full walkthrough in [Quick Start](https://samuelpkg.github.io/samuel/getting-started/quick-start/).

## For v1 users

v2 is a clean break. The binary name is the same; installing v2 overwrites v1. The v1 source lives at the [`v1-final`](https://github.com/samuelpkg/samuel/tree/v1-final) tag.

If you used `CLAUDE.md` directly, install the [Claude translator plugin](https://github.com/samuelpkg/samuel-claude-translator) — it mirrors `AGENTS.md → CLAUDE.md` on every `samuel sync`. If you used `gstack` or `gbrain`, see [RFD 0008](https://samuelpkg.github.io/samuel/rfd/0008/) for the rationale and migration path.
