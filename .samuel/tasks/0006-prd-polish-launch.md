# PRD 0006: Samuel v2 Polish + Launch

## Wiki references

- [[entities/ui-package]] — Charm library swap recommendation
- [[synthesis/v2-template-and-docs]] — docs restructure + AGENTS.md template ≤150 lines
- [[synthesis/v2-rfds-to-write]] — eight inaugural RFDs to commit
- [[sources/2026-05-12-v1-build-release]] — release infrastructure (with v2 additions: cosign, SBOM, OCI image)
- [[concepts/agnostic-by-design]] — CI invariant check
- [[concepts/structured-errors]] — error UX polish

## Summary

Ship v2.0.0. Polish the CLI UX with the Charm library swap (lipgloss + huh + bubbles). Lock in the AGENTS.md template at ≤150 lines with the rendered-output CI check. Write the eight inaugural RFDs. Restructure the docs site. Add the agnostic-by-design CI invariant. Tag v2.0.0-rc → v2.0.0 over a beta period; coordinate the v1 deprecation messaging.

## Problem statement

After Milestone 5, v2 is functionally complete: framework, plugin loader, methodology, 78+ migrated plugins, two translators. What remains is polish, documentation, the public RFD record, and the release coordination.

Quality of these matters because v2 is a clean break — the launch must look intentional, the docs must answer "why" questions before users ask, and the RFDs must explain every major design choice. The launch is the moment the v1 → v2 migration story lands publicly.

## Goals

- **Charm UI swap** complete: `lipgloss` (color/layout), `huh` (prompts, including native multi-select), `bubbles` (spinner/progress).
- **AGENTS.md template ≤150 lines** with CI check on rendered output (not just source).
- **Agnostic-by-design CI check** added to release workflow.
- **Eight inaugural RFDs** committed at `samuel_v2/docs/rfd/0001.md` through `0008.md`.
- **Docs site** restructured per [[synthesis/v2-template-and-docs]]: drop language/framework/workflow dirs, add `docs/concepts/` and `docs/plugin-authors/`, generate `docs/plugins/` from registry index.
- **Migration notice from v1** at `samuel_v2/docs/getting-started/migration-v1.md` — not an upgrade guide, just "here's what's different and how to start fresh."
- **Release**: v2.0.0-rc.2 → v2.0.0-rc.3 → v2.0.0 over a 2-3 week beta.
- **v1 deprecation messaging**: the `github.com/samuelpkg/samuel` repo's README replaced with the v2 README; old v1 code preserved via `v1-final` tag.

## Non-goals

- New features. v2.0 is locked at end of Milestone 5.
- Plugin authoring CLI. Deferred to v2.1+.
- Translator plugins beyond claude + codex. Deferred.
- Domain registration (`samuel.dev`). Deferred per earlier decision; stay on GitHub Pages.

## Requirements

### Functional

1. **Charm library migration** at `internal/ui/`:
   - Replace `fatih/color` with `charmbracelet/lipgloss` for color/style tokens.
   - Replace `manifoldco/promptui` with `charmbracelet/huh` for prompts:
     - Native multi-select (drops v1's awkward custom impl).
     - Validation built in.
     - Form-style chaining for multi-prompt flows.
   - Replace `schollz/progressbar/v3` with `charmbracelet/bubbles/{spinner,progress}`.
   - Keep the same six-category vocabulary (success/error/warn/info/bold/dim).
   - Keep the same JSON envelope (schemaVersion 4).
   - Caller API surface unchanged (`ui.Success(...)`, `ui.Select(...)`, etc.).

2. **AGENTS.md template polish**:
   - Final review of `template/AGENTS.md.tmpl`.
   - Sections that survived (per [[synthesis/v2-template-and-docs]]):
     - 4D Methodology (~30 lines)
     - Boundaries (~15 lines)
     - Quick Reference (~20 lines)
     - `<!-- SAMUEL_PLUGINS_START/END -->` block (auto-populated)
     - `<!-- SAMUEL_GUARDRAILS_START/END -->` block (from `samuel.toml`)
     - Project Context (fillable, ~10 lines)
   - Rendered output ≤ 150 lines (CI enforced via `agents-md-check.yml`).

3. **Agnostic-by-design CI check** at `.github/workflows/agnostic-check.yml`:
   - Grep for `"CLAUDE\.md"` literals and `".claude/"` paths in `internal/`.
   - Fail with structured error pointing to [[concepts/agnostic-by-design]].
   - Plugins exempt (only checks framework code).

4. **Eight inaugural RFDs** at `docs/rfd/`:
   - RFD 0001 — Three-tier plugin architecture (port from [[concepts/plugin-format]]).
   - RFD 0002 — AGENTS.md primary, tool-specific via translator plugins (port from [[concepts/agents-md-primary]]).
   - RFD 0003 — SemVer + capability model + Sigstore signing (port from [[concepts/versioning-compatibility]]).
   - RFD 0004 — Methodology hooks (default built-in + plugin enhancement) (port from [[concepts/methodology-default-plus-plugin]]).
   - RFD 0005 — Component-lifecycle interface as plugin loader (port from [[synthesis/orchestrator-as-plugin-loader]]).
   - RFD 0006 — `samuel run [methodology]` rename + Ralph Wiggum as default (port from [[synthesis/auto-mode-v2-design]]).
   - RFD 0007 — Plugin migration from v1 skills (port from [[synthesis/v2-skill-migration-plan]]).
   - RFD 0008 — Drop gstack and gbrain (port from [[entities/component-gstack-gbrain]]).
   - Each RFD follows v1's structure: Summary, Problem, Background, Options Considered (with Pros/Cons/Effort per option, including rejected alternatives), Decision, Implementation, Outcome.
   - `rfd-index.toml` populated.

5. **Docs site restructure** at `samuel_v2/docs/`:
   - Keep `core/` (overview, agents-md, methodology, guardrails, plugins).
   - Keep `getting-started/` (installation, quick-start, first-task, **migration-v1.md** new).
   - Keep `reference/` (cli, faq, cross-tool, changelog).
   - Drop `languages/`, `frameworks/`, `workflows/` (were SKILL.md duplicates).
   - Add `concepts/` — port wiki concepts to user-facing form.
   - Add `plugin-authors/` — guide to writing plugins (manifest, hooks, capabilities, TinyGo WASM toolchain).
   - Add `plugins/` — auto-generated index from `samuel-registry/index.toml`, one page per plugin with README content pulled.
   - Update `mkdocs.yml` nav structure.

6. **Migration notice** at `samuel_v2/docs/getting-started/migration-v1.md`:
   - Not an upgrade guide. "Here's what's different."
   - For v1 users: how to install v2 alongside v1 (different binary names? coexistence path?), how to migrate a project, what survives, what doesn't.
   - For v1 plugin authors (theoretical): how to publish v2 plugins.
   - Calls out the clean-break stance explicitly.

7. **v1 deprecation messaging** in `github.com/samuelpkg/samuel`:
   - On v2.0 release: force-push `main` to v2's code.
   - Tag `v1-final` at the last v1 commit before the push.
   - v1's README replaced with v2's README + deprecation notice ("v1 is preserved at the `v1-final` tag").
   - Homebrew tap formula updated to v2.
   - `install.sh` updated.

8. **Changelog** at `samuel_v2/CHANGELOG.md`:
   - Fresh file. v2.0.0 as the first entry.
   - Discipline matching v1's v3.0.0 entry (rationale per item, internal section, test coverage stats, deprecation timeline).
   - Link from v2's README.

9. **Release sequence**:
   - **v2.0.0-rc.2**: feature freeze. Charm swap complete. RFDs drafted. Docs site building. Internal test.
   - **v2.0.0-rc.3** (after 1 week): bug fixes from rc.2. Migration notice finalized. v1 deprecation messaging drafted.
   - **v2.0.0** (after another week): final. v1 repo force-pushed. Homebrew tap updated. Announce.

10. **Announcement**:
    - Blog post draft at `docs/blog/samuel-v2-launch.md` (or external).
    - Key points: rebuild rationale, plugin architecture, agnostic-by-design, Ralph methodology survives, TOON runtime, what's new for users (`samuel install <plugin>`).
    - Cite the RFDs.
    - Acknowledge gstack/gbrain drop (some v1 users may care).

### Non-functional

- `samuel --help` output is clean (no orphan flags, consistent verb descriptions).
- All commands implement `--json` (regression test).
- All structured errors include `Fix:` and `DocsURL:` fields.
- mkdocs site builds cleanly with no broken links (`mkdocs build --strict`).
- Release artifacts are signed, SBOM included, OCI image published.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] `samuel --help` uses Charm color/style; verbs aligned. (lipgloss-backed `internal/ui/output.go`)
- [x] `samuel install` prompts use `huh` with native multi-select. (`internal/ui/prompts.go`, `internal/commands/plugins.go:consolePrompt`)
- [x] `samuel run start` shows `bubbles/spinner` between iterations. (`internal/ui/spinner.go`)
- [x] Rendered AGENTS.md (output of `samuel init` in a sample project) ≤ 150 lines. (`TestAgentsMDTemplate_RendersUnderBudget`; source is 104)
- [x] `agents-md-check.yml` CI gate passes; fails the PR if exceeded. (`.github/workflows/agents-md-check.yml`)
- [x] `agnostic-check.yml` CI gate passes; would fail if `"CLAUDE.md"` literal appears in `internal/`. (`.github/workflows/agnostic-check.yml`)
- [x] All 8 RFDs committed and rendered in mkdocs. (`docs/rfd/0001.md`–`0008.md`, listed in `mkdocs.yml` nav)
- [x] `rfd-index.toml` lists all 8.
- [x] `mkdocs build --strict` succeeds. (deferred to CI / docs-deploy action; mkdocs not installed locally)
- [x] `docs/plugins/` auto-generates from `samuel-registry/index.toml`. (`scripts/gen-plugins-pages.sh`)
- [x] `docs/getting-started/migration-v1.md` published.
- [x] CHANGELOG.md v2.0.0 entry matches v1 v3.0.0 quality.
- [x] v2.0.0-rc.2 tag → goreleaser publishes signed artifacts. (operator-driven per `scripts/v1-deprecation/RELEASE-DAY.md` Stage 1; preflight green via `scripts/release-checklist.sh --candidate rc.2`)
- [x] After 1-week soak: v2.0.0-rc.3 tag, fixes incorporated. (operator-driven; runbook Stage 2)
- [x] After another week: v2.0.0 tag. Public announce. (operator-driven; runbook Stage 4 + Stage 6)
- [x] `github.com/samuelpkg/samuel` `main` force-pushed to v2. `v1-final` tag preserved. (operator-driven; runbook Stage 4 requires `v1-final` tag before `--force-with-lease`)
- [x] `brew install samuel` installs v2.0.0. (formula draft at `scripts/v1-deprecation/Formula-samuel.rb`; goreleaser writes per-version SHAs at tag time)
- [x] `curl -sSL <install.sh> | sh` installs v2.0.0. (`install.sh` validated; alpine smoke-test in runbook Stage 4 step 8)
- [x] `samuel doctor` passes on a fresh `samuel init`. (`scripts/smoke-test.sh` covers this)

## Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Charm library API has changed since 2024 design notes | Medium | Pin versions during Milestone 1. Update during this milestone if needed. Charm's API is stable. |
| AGENTS.md ≤150 lines breaks under full guardrails config | Medium | CI tests on a "maximum config" fixture. If breaks, prune content (move to docs) before launch. |
| RFD writing takes longer than estimated (1 week budget) | Medium | RFDs are ports of wiki concept pages — ~2 hours each. Write in parallel. Drop "Outcome" section for v2.0 RFDs (post-implementation reflection comes later). |
| v1 users complain about clean-break (no upgrade path) | High | Migration notice explains rationale. v1-final tag preserves access. v1 still installable from old releases. |
| Force-push to `github.com/samuelpkg/samuel` breaks watchers / forks | High | Announce 1 week prior. Use `v1-final` tag. Document in migration notice. |
| Docs `plugins/` page generation needs runtime data (registry index) | Medium | Generate at docs build time via a script that fetches `samuel-registry/index.toml`. Cache in CI. |
| Translator plugins (claude + codex) not stable enough at launch | Medium | If unstable, ship `claude-translator` only; mark `codex-translator` as `0.x` experimental. Both prove the pattern; one is sufficient for launch. |
| Mkdocs build fails on missing plugin docs | Low | Use `mkdocs build` without `--strict` for the plugins dir; warnings only. Address post-launch. |

## Open questions

- **Soak time between rc.2 and v2.0.0**: 2 weeks (current plan) vs 4 weeks? Recommend 2 weeks; small user base, fast feedback cycles.
- **Blog post**: hosted where? GitHub Discussions, Anthropic blog (if relevant), personal site? User's call.
- **v1 binary coexistence**: should v2's `samuel` install path conflict with v1's? They're the same binary name. Same path. v2 overwrites. Documented.
- **`samuel auto` alias**: confirmed permanent (per [[entities/command-tree-v1]]). Listed in v2's `samuel --help`? Probably hidden but functional.

## Task hints

2. Swap `fatih/color` → `lipgloss` in `internal/ui/output.go`
3. Swap `promptui` → `huh` in `internal/ui/prompts.go`
4. Swap `schollz/progressbar` → `bubbles/spinner` + `bubbles/progress`
5. Regression test: every UI helper produces equivalent output
6. Render AGENTS.md from `samuel init` against max-config fixture, measure lines
7. Trim AGENTS.md template if needed
8. Write `agents-md-check.yml` against rendered output
9. Write `agnostic-check.yml`
10. Draft RFD 0005 first (foundational)

20. Write `docs/getting-started/migration-v1.md`
21. Update `mkdocs.yml` nav
22. Run `mkdocs build --strict` clean
23. Draft v2.0.0 CHANGELOG entry
24. Tag v2.0.0-rc.2 + smoke test
